# HelloID-Conn-SA-Full-AzureAD-Guest-Invite

| :information_source: Information |
| :------------------------------- |
| This repository contains the connector and configuration code only. The implementer is responsible for acquiring the connection details and prerequisites (Azure AD app registration, certificate, permissions, etc.). |

## Description
HelloID-Conn-SA-Full-AzureAD-Guest-Invite is a template designed for use with HelloID Service Automation (SA) Delegated Forms. It can be imported into HelloID and customized according to your requirements.

By using this delegated form, you can invite external users (guests) to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and optionally add them to selected groups. The form provides:
1. Entering the guest user's email address
2. Entering given name and last name
3. Optional personal message in the invitation
4. Selecting Microsoft 365 or Security groups to add the guest to
5. Sending the invitation and applying selected group memberships

## Getting started

#### App Registration & Certificate Setup

Before implementing this connector, make sure to configure a Microsoft Entra ID, an App Registration. During the setup process, you’ll create a new App Registration in the Entra portal, assign the necessary API permissions (such as user and group read/write), and generate and assign a certificate.

Follow the official Microsoft documentation for creating an App Registration and setting up certificate-based authentication:
- [App-only authentication with certificate (Exchange Online)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/app-only-auth-powershell-v2?view=exchange-ps#set-up-app-only-authentication)

#### HelloID-specific configuration

Once you have completed the Microsoft setup and followed their best practices, configure the following HelloID-specific requirements.

- **API Permissions** (Application permissions):
  - `User.ReadWrite.All`
  - `Group.ReadWrite.All`
  - `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`
  - `UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All`
  - `User.EnableDisableAccount.All`
  - `User-PasswordProfile.ReadWrite.All`
  - `User-Phone.ReadWrite.All`
- **Certificate:**
  - Upload the public key file (.cer) in Entra ID
  - Provide the certificate as a Base64 string in HelloID. For instructions on creating the certificate and obtaining the base64 string, refer to our forum post: [Setting up a certificate for Microsoft Graph API in HelloID connectors](https://forum.helloid.com/forum/helloid-provisioning/5338-instruction-setting-up-a-certificate-for-microsoft-graph-api-in-helloid-connectors#post5338)

### Connection settings

The following user-defined (global) variables are used by the connector.

| Setting                         | Description                                        | Mandatory |
| --------------------------------| -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| EntraIdAppId                    | Application (client) ID of the Entra ID app       | Yes       |
| EntraIdTenantId                 | Directory (tenant) ID                             | Yes       |
| EntraIdCertificateBase64String  | Base64-encoded contents of the PFX certificate    | Yes       |
| EntraIdCertificatePassword      | Password for the PFX certificate                   | Yes       |
| companyName                     | Branding value used in invitation messaging        | No        |

> Note: When running inside HelloID, `portalUrl`, `apiKey`, and `apiSecret` are provided automatically after generating and storing API credentials in the Admin panel.

### All-in-one setup script

Use the all-in-one script to create the delegated form, dynamic form, data sources, tasks, and required HelloID global variables.

- Script: [All-in-one setup/createform.ps1](All-in-one%20setup/createform.ps1)

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

```powershell
# Navigate to the repository root
Set-Location "c:\HelloID\Template V2\HelloID-Conn-SA-Full-AzureAD-Guest-Invite"

# Run the all-in-one setup script
& "All-in-one setup/createform.ps1"
```

## Remarks

### Authentication (App-only via certificate)
- Uses Microsoft Graph application permissions with certificate-based client credentials. Supply `EntraIdCertificateBase64String` and `EntraIdCertificatePassword` along with `EntraIdAppId` and `EntraIdTenantId`.

### Group selection
- The form loads Microsoft 365 and Security groups via a data source and allows multi-select assignment during invite.

### Microsoft Graph API scope
- Group listing leverages supported group types from Microsoft Graph. Distribution lists and mail-enabled security groups are not supported by the endpoints used here.

### Invitation message and audit
- The invitation supports a personal message. Actions are logged for auditing within HelloID.

## Introduction
The interface to communicate with Microsoft Azure AD is through the Microsoft Graph API.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting the Azure AD graph API access

By using this connector you will have the ability to Invite Guests.

### Application Registration
The first step to connect to Graph API and make requests, is to register a new <b>Azure Active Directory Application</b>. The application is used to connect to the API and to manage permissions.

* Navigate to <b>App Registrations</b> in Azure, and select “New Registration” (<b>Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registration > New Application Registration</b>).
* Next, give the application a name. In this example we are using “<b>HelloID PowerShell</b>” as application name.
* Specify who can use this application (<b>Accounts in this organizational directory only</b>).
* Specify the Redirect URI. You can enter any url as a redirect URI value. In this example we used http://localhost because it doesn't have to resolve.
* Click the “<b>Register</b>” button to finally create your new application.

Some key items regarding the application are the Application ID (which is the Client ID), the Directory ID (which is the Tenant ID) and Client Secret.

### Configuring App Permissions
The [Microsoft Graph documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph) provides details on which permission are required for each permission type.

To assign your application the right permissions, navigate to <b>Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory >App Registrations</b>.
Select the application we created before, and select “<b>API Permissions</b>” or “<b>View API Permissions</b>”.
To assign a new permission to your application, click the “<b>Add a permission</b>” button.
From the “<b>Request API Permissions</b>” screen click “<b>Microsoft Graph</b>”.
For this connector the following permissions are used as <b>Application permissions</b>:
*	Read and Write all user’s full profiles by using <b><i>User.ReadWrite.All</i></b>
*	Invite Guests by using <b><i>User.Invite.All</i></b>

Some high-privilege permissions can be set to admin-restricted and require an administrators consent to be granted.

To grant admin consent to our application press the “<b>Grant admin consent for TENANT</b>” button.

### Authentication and Authorization
There are multiple ways to authenticate to the Graph API with each has its own pros and cons, in this example we are using the Authorization Code grant type.

*	First we need to get the <b>Client ID</b>, go to the <b>Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App Registrations</b>.
*	Select your application and copy the Application (client) ID value.
*	After we have the Client ID we also have to create a <b>Client Secret</b>.
*	From the Azure Portal, go to <b>Azure Active Directory > App Registrations</b>.
*	Select the application we have created before, and select "<b>Certificates and Secrets</b>". 
*	Under “Client Secrets” click on the “<b>New Client Secret</b>” button to create a new secret.
*	Provide a logical name for your secret in the Description field, and select the expiration date for your secret.
*	It's IMPORTANT to copy the newly generated client secret, because you cannot see the value anymore after you close the page.
*	At least we need to get is the <b>Tenant ID</b>. This can be found in the Azure Portal by going to <b>Azure Active Directory > Custom Domain Names</b>, and then finding the .onmicrosoft.com domain.


## All-in-one PowerShell setup script
The PowerShell script "createform.ps1" contains a complete PowerShell script using the HelloID API to create the complete Form including user defined variables, tasks and data sources.

_Please note that this script asumes none of the required resources do exists within HelloID. The script does not contain versioning or source control_

### Getting started
Please follow the documentation steps on [HelloID Docs](https://docs.helloid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017556559-Service-automation-GitHub-resources) in order to setup and run the All-in one Powershell Script in your own environment.


## Post-setup configuration
After the all-in-one PowerShell script has run and created all the required resources. The following items need to be configured according to your own environment
 1. Update the following [user defined variables](https://docs.helloid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014169933-How-to-Create-and-Manage-User-Defined-Variables)
<table>
  <tr><td><strong>Variable name</strong></td><td><strong>Example value</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>AADtenantID</td><td>Azure AD Tenant Id</td><td>Id of the Azure tenant</td></tr>
  <tr><td>AADAppId</td><td>Azure AD App Id</td><td>Id of the Azure app</td></tr>
<tr><td>AADAppSecret</td><td>Azure AD App Secret</td><td>Secret of the Azure app</td></tr>
</table>
